So here is the thing…I saved the data when it was working. So when I open it was pre populating. I modified data for one of the field to Test1…after submit….it calls the API…you see it still showing previous saved data not a modified one… this scenario is with the saved data when it was working.


Now if it’s pretty new and never saved…now when I open, an empty dialog box opened and enter data with all mandatory fields(test2 and the rest).now submit. When I submit…it is sending as null.

What can be the issue? What’s changed with your fix?
