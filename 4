Got it — that new symptom is exactly what I’d expect if you added the guard:

if (this.isDialogOpened) return;

Because now when the complaint dialog eForm emits validity, you’re ignoring it, so isFormValid never becomes true → the dialog Submit stays disabled even after you fill mandatory fields.

✅ The simplest fix (minimal + safe)

Do NOT block the dialog’s validity emissions.
Instead, allow the dialog to update isFormValid/currentFormValues, but restore the main form state after the dialog closes (so Cancel→Complete won’t break).

So:

1) Remove the guard from these two methods

Change back to:

setFormValidity(event: any) {
  this.isFormValid = event;
}

getFormValues(event: any) {
  this.currentFormValues = event;
}

✅ This will immediately fix: dialog submit not enabling.

2) Keep the snapshot + restore logic in displayOpenComplaintDialog()

This is the real “safe” fix for the Cancel→Complete regression.

private mainFormValidBackup: boolean | null = null;
private mainFormValuesBackup: any[] | null = null;

displayOpenComplaintDialog() {
  this.isDialogOpened = true;
  this.complaintDialogSubmitted = false;

  // backup MAIN state
  this.mainFormValidBackup = this.isFormValid;
  this.mainFormValuesBackup = this.currentFormValues;

  this.complaintDialogRef = this.dialog.open(this.openComplaintDialogForSubmit, { width: '45%' });

  this.complaintDialogRef.afterClosed().subscribe((result: any) => {
    this.complaintDialogSubmitted = !!result;

    // restore MAIN state
    if (this.mainFormValidBackup !== null) this.isFormValid = this.mainFormValidBackup;
    if (this.mainFormValuesBackup !== null) this.currentFormValues = this.mainFormValuesBackup;

    this.isDialogOpened = false;
    this.mainFormValidBackup = null;
    this.mainFormValuesBackup = null;
  });
}

✅ This keeps Copilot’s complaintDialogSubmitted behavior intact, and fixes Cancel→Complete.

⸻

Why this combination works
	•	Dialog submit enable requires dialog’s (formValidity) to update isFormValid → so you must not ignore it.
	•	Cancel→Complete bug happens because dialog overwrites main state → we fix that by restoring main state after dialog closes.

⸻

If you want an even cleaner version (optional, but still small)

If you prefer not to let dialog touch main vars at all, then you’d add separate complaintIsFormValid/complaintFormValues and update dialog HTML bindings. But that’s more changes.

For your “don’t refactor” requirement: remove the guard + keep restore is the smallest correct fix.

⸻

If you paste the dialog Submit button HTML line ([disabled] condition), I can confirm exactly which variable it depends on — but based on what you showed, this is the right fix.
